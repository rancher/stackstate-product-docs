:description: SUSE Observability

== Overview

When your SUSE Observability SaaS instance has been set up and configured, you will receive an email from SUSE Observability
with the required login details. This quick start guide will help you get started and get your own data into
your SUSE Observability SaaS instance.

To integrate your cluster(s) with SUSE Observability you can follow one of these guides for your appropriate environment.

=== Prerequisites for Kubernetes

To set up a SUSE Observability Kubernetes integration you need to have:

* An up-and-running Kubernetes Cluster.
* Helm version 3.13.1 or higher.
* A user with the permission to `create privileged pods`, `ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings`:
 ** ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding are needed to grant SUSE Observability Agents permissions to access the Kubernetes API.
 ** SUSE Observability Agents need to run in a privileged pod to be able to gather information on network connections and host information.

=== Set up a Kubernetes integration

[CAUTION]
====
Before you begin, check the <<prerequisites-for-kubernetes,prerequisites for Kubernetes>>.
====


To get data from a Kubernetes cluster into SUSE Observability, follow the steps described below:

. Add the SUSE Observability helm repository to the local helm client:
+
[,buildoutcfg]
----
 helm repo add suse-observability https://charts.rancher.com/server-charts/prime/suse-observability
 helm repo update
----

. In the SUSE Observability UI, open the main menu by clicking in the top left of the screen and go to `StackPacks` > `Integrations` > `Kubernetes`.
. Install a new instance of the Kubernetes StackPack:
 ** Specify a *Kubernetes Cluster Name*
  *** This name will be used to identify the cluster in SUSE Observability
 ** Click *install*.
. Deploy the SUSE Observability Agent, Cluster Agent, Checks Agent and kube-state-metrics on your Cluster using the helm command provided in the SUSE Observability UI after you have installed the StackPack.
 ** Once the Agents have been deployed, they will begin collecting data and push this to SUSE Observability

[CAUTION]
====
When running on a self-hosted air-gapped environment prepare the agent installation first with the xref:./k8s-suse-rancher-prime-agent-air-gapped.adoc[air-gapped instructions].
