== Release Notes SUSE Observability Helm Chart version 2.3.0

=== New Features & Enhancements

* Support for a 4000 Nodes HA deployment profile was added.
* The following libraries and container images were upgraded to fix CVEs in Suse Observability.
 ** HDFS
 ** Avro
 ** Protobuf
 ** Pac4j
 ** Logback
 ** Sts-toolbox
 ** All Suse Observability base images
 ** Kafka and Kafka operator
 ** Victoria metrics
 ** Container tools
 ** Minio
 ** Nginx prometheus exporter

=== Bug Fixes

* Fix issue where the vmrestore docker image could not be pulled from the rancher docker repositories.
* Fixed an issue where helm install would fail due to the suse-observability-backup-conf job exiting so fast that helm does not observe it.
* Fix bug where fullComponents() in scriptAPI would fail with a `Could not find elements` message.

=== Breaking changes

* Using `stackstate.components.all.image.pullSecretUserName` for defining pull-secrets was removed from the suse-observability helm chart. The way to define a pull secret is through the `suse-observability-values` (see link:/k8s-suse-rancher-prime-air-gapped.adoc#installing-suse-observability[air-gapped installation instructions]) or through `pull-secret.credentials` in the `suse-observability` chart.

== Agent Bug Fixes

* Fix SUSE Observability agent not installing due to a pull secret not yet being created during running of a helm prehook.
* Fix issue where the SUSE Observability agent prevents containerd tmpmounts to be unmounted
