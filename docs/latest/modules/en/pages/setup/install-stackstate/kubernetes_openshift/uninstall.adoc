== Un-install the Helm chart

[NOTE]
====
Un-installing the helm chart will preserve all data because helm will not remove the Persistent Volume Claims nor the namespace. To remove those as well also xref:/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_openshift/uninstall.adoc#_remove_remaining_resources[remove the remaining resources].
====


To un-install SUSE Observability the first action is to run the `helm uninstall` command. This command will remove all resources created by the `helm upgrade --install` command.

Uninstall the `suse-observability` release from the `suse-observability` namespace like this, replace the namespace or release name with any custom names used during installation:

----
helm uninstall --namespace suse-observability suse-observability
----

The command will return almost immediately but shutting down all the pods and removing all other resources can take a while. Check if all pods are gone with:

----
kubectl get pods --namespace suse-observability
----

If you want to re-install SUSE Observability later and have the old data still available this is all, for a full uninstall continue with the next 2 sections.

== Remove remaining resources

[CAUTION]
====
Removing the Persistent Volume Claims and/or the namespace will result in all data being lost that was stored in SUSE Observability.
====


To remove the namespace and with that, the Persistent Volume Claims and their linked Persistent Volumes simply remove the entire namespace:

----
kubectl delete namespace suse-observability
----

When the command returns the namespace and all volumes will have been removed.

To only remove the Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and keep the namespace run:

----
kubectl delete pvc --all -n suse-observability
----

On OpenShift the Helm chart also created a security context constraint (SCC). It is not cleaned up automatically by Helm but instead needs to be manually removed:

----
# The scc is always named suse-observability-<namespace>
oc delete scc suse-observability-suse-observability
----

== Remove manually created resources

[NOTE]
====
Even if you intend to re-install SUSE Observability on the same cluster but in a different namespace these can be removed. The resources contain references to the SUSE Observability namespace.
====


As described in the xref:/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_openshift/required_permissions.adoc#_manually_create_cluster_wide_resources[required permissions] it might have been necessary that your cluster admin created some resources manually. These resources can now be removed again, but that also is a manual task that requires admin permission.

Delete the cluster role and the cluster role bindings that have been created like this:

----
kubectl delete cluster-role suse-observability-authorization
kubectl delete cluster-role-binding suse-observability-authorization
kubectl delete cluster-role-binding suse-observability-authentication
----
