:description: Overview of Open Telemetry Mappings

SUSE Observability can automatically derive application and infrastructure topology from OpenTelemetry (OTel) telemetry data.
This is achieved through OpenTelemetry topology mappings, which declaratively transform trace and metric signals into topology components (vertices) and relations (edges).

These mappings allow you to describe what topology should be created from telemetry.
They are evaluated as part of the topology pipeline inside the OpenTelemetry Collector.
The resulting component and relation objects are emitted downstream and later materialised by the SUSE Observability platform once the required vertices are available.

== Overview

At a high level, topology generation from OpenTelemetry works as follows:

* OpenTelemetry telemetry (metrics and/or traces) is received by the Collector
* The topology pipeline evaluates configured mappings against the telemetry
* When mapping conditions match, components and/or relations are produced
* These topology objects are consumed by the platform backend and merged into the topology graph
* Mappings are declarative, YAML-based, and evaluated continuously as telemetry flows through the system

Currently supported signals:

* Metrics
* Traces

Log-based topology generation is not yet supported.

The xref:/setup/otel/otelmappings/concepts.adoc[concepts] page provides more details about component and relation mappings.
