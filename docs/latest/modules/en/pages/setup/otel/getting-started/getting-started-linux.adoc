:description: SUSE Observability

Here is the setup we'll be creating, for an application that needs to be monitored:

* The monitored application / workload running on a Linux host
* The Open Telemetry collector running on the same Linux host
* SUSE Observability or SUSE Cloud Observability

== Install the Open Telemetry collector

[NOTE]
====
For a production setup it is strongly recommended to install the collector, since it allows your service to offload data quickly and the collector can take care of additional handling like retries, batching, encryption or even sensitive data filtering.
====


First we'll install the collector. We configure it to:

* Receive data from, potentially many, instrumented applications
* Enrich collected data with host attributes
* Generate metrics for traces
* Forward the data to SUSE Observability, including authentication using the API key

Next to that it will also retry sending data when there are a connection problems.

=== Create a Service Token

There are two ways to create a service token:

* **SUSE Observability UI** - open the main menu by clicking in the top left of the screen and go to `StackPacks` > `Open Telemetry`.  If you haven't done so before, click the `INSTALL` button.  Click the `CREATE NEW SERVICE TOKEN` button and copy the value onto your clipboard.
* **SUSE Observability CLI** - see xref:/use/security/k8s-service-tokens.adoc#_manage_service_tokens[Manage service tokens]

The service token value must be used where the instructions below mention `<SERVICE_TOKEN>`.

=== Install and configure the collector

The collector provides packages (apk, deb and rpm) for most Linux versions and architectures and it uses `systemd` for automatic service configuration. To install it find the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases[latest release on Github] and update the URL in the example to use the latest version:

For other installation options use the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/#_linux[Open Telemetry instructions].

After installation modify the collector configuration by editing `/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml`. Change the file such that it looks like the `config.yaml` example here, replace `<otlp-suse-observability-endpoint:port>` with your OTLP endpoint (see xref:/setup/otel/otlp-apis.adoc[OTLP API] for your endpoint) and insert your service token for `<SERVICE_TOKEN>`:

      exporters: [nop]

Finally restart the collector:

[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl restart otelcol-contrib
----

To see the logs of the collector use:

[,bash]
----
sudo journalctl -u otelcol-contrib

== Collect telemetry data from your application

The common way to collect telemetry data is to instrument your application using the Open Telemetry SDK's. We've documented some quick start guides for a few languages, but there are many more:

* xref:/setup/otel/instrumentation/java.adoc[Java]
* xref:/setup/otel/instrumentation/dot-net.adoc[.NET]
* xref:/setup/otel/instrumentation/node.js.adoc[Node.js]

No additional configuration is needed for the SDKs, they export to localhost via OTLP or OTLP over HTTP (depending on the supported protocols) by default.

For other languages follow the documentation on https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/[opentelemetry.io].

== View the results

Go to SUSE Observability and make sure the Open Telemetry Stackpack is installed (via the main menu \-> Stackpacks).

After a short while and if your application is processing some traffic you should be able to find it under its service name in the Open Telemetry \-> services and service instances overviews. Traces will appear in the xref:/use/traces/k8sTs-explore-traces.adoc[trace explorer] and in the xref:/use/views/k8s-traces-perspective.adoc[trace perspective] for the service and service instance components. Span metrics and language specific metrics (if available) will become available in the xref:/use/views/k8s-metrics-perspective.adoc[metrics perspective] for the components.

== Next steps

You can add new charts to components, for example the service or service instance, for your application, by following xref:/use/metrics/k8s-add-charts.adoc[our guide]. It is also possible to create xref:/use/alerting/k8s-monitors.adoc[new monitors] using the metrics and setup xref:/use/alerting/notifications/configure.adoc[notifications] to get notified when your application is not available or having performance issues.
