= Getting Started with Open Telemetry operator on Kubernetes
:revdate: 2025-07-10
:page-revdate: {revdate}
:description: SUSE Observability

Here is the setup we'll be creating, for an application that needs to be monitored:

* The monitored application / workload running in cluster A, auto-instrumented by the operator
* The Open Telemetry operator in cluster A
* A collector created by the operator
* SUSE Observability running in cluster B, or SUSE Cloud Observability

== Install the operator

The Open Telemetry operator offers some extra features over the normal Kubernetes setup:

* It can auto-instrument your application pods for supported languages (Java, .NET, Python, Golang, Node.js), without having to modify the applications or docker images at all
* It can be dropped in as a replacement for the Prometheus operator and start scraping Prometheus exporter endpoints based on service and pod monitors

=== Create a Service Token

There are two ways to create a service token:

* **SUSE Observability UI** - open the main menu by clicking in the top left of the screen and go to `StackPacks` > `Open Telemetry`.  If you haven't done so before, click the `INSTALL` button.  Click the `CREATE NEW SERVICE TOKEN` button and copy the value onto your clipboard.
* **SUSE Observability CLI** - see xref:/use/security/k8s-service-tokens.adoc#_manage_service_tokens[Manage service tokens]

The service token value must be used where the instructions below mention `<SERVICE_TOKEN>`.

=== Create the namespace and a secret for the service token

We'll install in the `open-telemetry` namespace and use the service token:

[,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace open-telemetry
kubectl create secret generic open-telemetry-collector \
    --namespace open-telemetry \
    --from-literal=API_KEY='<SERVICE_TOKEN>'
----

=== Configure & Install the operator

The operator is installed with a Helm chart, so first configure the chart repository.

[,bash]
----
helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts
----

Let's create a `otel-operator.yaml` file to configure the operator:

.otel-operator.yaml
[,yaml]
----
# Add image pull secret for private registries
imagePullSecrets: []
manager:
  image:
    # Uses chart.appVersion for the tag
    repository: ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/opentelemetry-operator
  collectorImage:
    # find the latest collector releases at https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases
    repository: otel/opentelemetry-collector-k8s
    tag: 0.123.0
  targetAllocatorImage:
    repository: ""
    tag: ""
  # Only needed when overriding the image repository, make sure to always specify both the image and tag:
  autoInstrumentationImage:
    java:
      repository: ""
      tag: ""
    nodejs:
      repository: ""
      tag: ""
    python:
      repository: ""
      tag: ""
    dotnet:
      repository: ""
      tag: ""
    # The Go instrumentation support in the operator is disabled by default.
    # To enable it, use the operator.autoinstrumentation.go feature gate.
    go:
      repository: ""
      tag: ""

admissionWebhooks:
  # A production setup should use certManager to generate the certificate, without certmanager the certificate will be generated during the Helm install
  certManager:
    enabled: false
  # The operator has validation and mutation hooks that need a certificate, with this we generate that automatically
  autoGenerateCert:
    enabled: true
----


Now install the collector, using the configuration file:

[,bash]
----
helm upgrade --install opentelemetry-operator open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator \
  --namespace open-telemetry \
  --values otel-operator.yaml
----

This only installs the operator. Continue to install the collector and enable auto-instrumentation.

== The Open Telemetry collector

The operator manages one or more collector deployments via a Kubernetes custom resource of kind `OpenTelemetryCollector`. We'll create one using the same configuration as used in the xref:/setup/otel/getting-started/getting-started-k8s.adoc[Kubernetes getting started guide].

It uses the secret created earlier in the guide. Make sure to replace `<otlp-suse-observability-endpoint:port>` with your OTLP endpoint (see xref:/setup/otel/otlp-apis.adoc[OTLP API] for your endpoint) and insert the name for your Kubernetes cluster instead of `<your-cluster-name>`:

.collector.yaml

----


[CAUTION]
====
*Use the same cluster name as used for installing the SUSE Observability agent* if you also use the SUSE Observability agent with the Kubernetes stackpack. Using a different cluster name will result in an empty traces perspective for Kubernetes components and will overall make correlating information much harder for SUSE Observability and your users.
====


Now apply this `collector.yaml` in the `open-telemetry` namespace to deploy a collector:

[,bash]
----
kubectl apply --namespace open-telemetry -f collector.yaml
----

The collector offers a lot more configuration receivers, processors and exporters, for more details see our xref:/setup/otel/collector.adoc[collector page]. For production usage often large amounts of spans are generated and you will want to start setting up xref:/setup/otel/sampling.adoc[sampling].

== Auto-instrumentation

=== Configure auto-instrumentation

Now we need to tell the operator how to configure the auto instrumentation for the different languages using another custom resource, of kind `Instrumentation`. It is mainly used to configure the collector that was just deployed as the telemetry endpoint for the instrumented applications.

It can be defined in a single place and used by all pods in the cluster, but it is also possible to have a different `Instrumentation` in each namespace. We'll be doing the former here. Note that if you used a different namespace or a different name for the otel collector the endpoint in this file needs to be updated accordingly.

Create an `instrumentation.yaml`:

.instrumentation.yaml
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: otel-instrumentation
spec:
  exporter:
    # default endpoint for the instrumentation
    endpoint: http://otel-collector-collector.open-telemetry.svc.cluster.local:4317
  propagators:
    - tracecontext
    - baggage
  defaults:
    # To use the standard app.kubernetes.io/ labels for the service name, version and namespace:
    useLabelsForResourceAttributes: true
  python:
    env:
      # Python autoinstrumentation uses http/proto by default, so data must be sent to 4318 instead of 4317.
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://otel-collector-collector.open-telemetry.svc.cluster.local:4318
  dotnet:
    env:
      # Dotnet autoinstrumentation uses http/proto by default, so data must be sent to 4318 instead of 4317.
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://otel-collector-collector.open-telemetry.svc.cluster.local:4318
  go:
    env:
      # Go autoinstrumentation uses http/proto by default, so data must be sent to 4318 instead of 4317.
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://otel-collector-collector.open-telemetry.svc.cluster.local:4318
----


Now apply the `instrumentation.yaml` also in the `open-telemetry` namespace:

[,bash]
----
kubectl apply --namespace open-telemetry -f instrumentation.yaml
----

=== Enable auto-instrumentation for a pod

To instruct the operator to auto-instrument your applicaction pods we need to add an annotation to the pod:

* Java: `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: open-telemetry/otel-instrumentation`
* NodeJS: `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs: open-telemetry/otel-instrumentation`
* Python: `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: open-telemetry/otel-instrumentation`
* Go: `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-go: open-telemetry/otel-instrumentation`

Note that the value of the annotation refers to the namespace and name of the `Instrumentation` resource that we created. Other options are:

* "true" - inject and `Instrumentation` custom resource from the namespace.
* "my-instrumentation" - name of `Instrumentation` custom resource in the current namespace.
* "my-other-namespace/my-instrumentation" - namespace and name of `Instrumentation` custom resource in another namespace.
* "false" - do not inject

When a pod with one of the annotations is created the operator modifies the pod via a mutation hook:

* It adds an init container that provides the auto-instrumentation library
* It modifies the first container of the pod to load the instrumentation during start up and it adds environment variables to configure the instrumentation

If you need to customize which containers should be instrumented use the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#_multi_container_pods_with_multiple_instrumentations[operator documentation].

[CAUTION]
====
Go auto-instrumentation requires elevated permissions. These permissions are set automatically by the operator:

[,yaml]
----
securityContext:
  privileged: true
  runAsUser: 0
----

====


== View the results

Go to SUSE Observability and make sure the Open Telemetry Stackpack is installed (via the main menu \-> Stackpacks).

After a short while and if your pods are getting some traffic you should be able to find them under their service name in the Open Telemetry \-> services and service instances overviews. Traces will appear in the xref:/use/traces/k8sTs-explore-traces.adoc[trace explorer] and in the xref:/use/views/k8s-traces-perspective.adoc[trace perspective] for the service and service instance components. Span metrics and language specific metrics (if available) will become available in the xref:/use/views/k8s-metrics-perspective.adoc[metrics perspective] for the components.

If you also have the Kubernetes stackpack installed the instrumented pods will also have the traces available in the xref:/use/views/k8s-traces-perspective.adoc[trace perspective].

== Rancher RBAC

For xref:/setup/security/rbac/rbac_rancher.adoc[Rancher RBAC] to work, telemetry data needs to have the following resource attributes present:

* `k8s.cluster.name` - the *Cluster* name as used by the Kubernetes stackpack
* `k8s.namespace.name` - a *Namespace* managed by a Rancher *Project*

The Kubernetes Operator will inject these attributes by default into any telemetry data that is sent.

== Next steps

You can add new charts to components, for example, the service or service instance, for your application, by following xref:/setup/custom-integrations/metric-bindings/README.adoc[our guide]. It is also possible to create xref:/use/alerting/k8s-monitors.adoc[new monitors] using the metrics and setup xref:/use/alerting/notifications/configure.adoc[notifications] to get notified when your application is not available or having performance issues.

The operator, the `OpenTelemetryCollector`, and the `Instrumentation` custom resource, have more options that are documented in the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator[readme of the operator repository]. For example it is possible to install an optional https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#_target_allocator[target allocator] via the `OpenTelemetryCollector` resource, it can be used to configure the Prometheus receiver of the collector. This is especially useful when you want to replace Prometheus operator and are using its `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor` custom resources.
