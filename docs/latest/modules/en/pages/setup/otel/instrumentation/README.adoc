:description: SUSE Observability

Open telemetry provides https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/[SDKs for many languages] to (auto-)instrument your application. Instrumentation enables your application to send traces, metrics and logs to SUSE Observability. Auto-instrumentation captures traces, metrics and logs for popular libraries and frameworks without any further manual intervention except including the SDK in your application.

Open Telemetry has many more SDKs than are documented here. If your language is not documented here you can use the documentation at https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/[opentelemetry.io] in combination with the xref:/setup/otel/instrumentation/sdk-exporter-config.adoc[SDK exporter configuration] needed for SUSE Observability.
