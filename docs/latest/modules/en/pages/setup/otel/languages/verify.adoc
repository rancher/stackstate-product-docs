= Verify the instrumentation is working
:description: SUSE Observability

If the collector and the instrumentation setup has been successful data should be available in SUSE Observability within about a minute or two.

You can check that SUSE Observability is receiving traces:

. Open SUSE Observability in a browser
. Find (one of) the pods that is instrumented
. Select the pod to open the Highlights page
. Open the trace perspective. If the pod is serving traffic it should now show traces

To check that SUSE Observability is receiving metrics:

. Open SUSE Observability in a browser
. Open the metrics explorer from the menu
. Search for the metrics exposed by your application

If there are still no metrics after 5 minutes something is likely mis-configured. See xref:/setup/otel/troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting] for help.
