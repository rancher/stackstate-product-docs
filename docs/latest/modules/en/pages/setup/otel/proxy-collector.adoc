= Open Telemetry Collector as a proxy
:revdate: 2025-07-10

:description: SUSE Observability

The normal configuration of the Opentelemetry Collector for tail-sampling traces can be found xref:/setup/otel/collector.adoc[here]

The below configuration describes a deployment that only does batching, and no further processing of traces, metrics,
or logs.  It is meant as a security proxy that exists outside the SUSE Observability cluster, but within trusted network
infrastructure.  Security credentials for the proxy and SUSE Observability can be set up separately, adding a layer of
authentication that does not reside with the caller, but with the host.

=== Ingress Source Range Whitelisting

To emphasize the role of the proxy collector as a security measure, it is recommended to use a source-range whitelist
to filter out data from untrusted and/or unknown sources.  In contrast, the SUSE Observability ingestion collector may
have to accept data from multiple sources, maintaining a whitelist on that level does not scale well.
