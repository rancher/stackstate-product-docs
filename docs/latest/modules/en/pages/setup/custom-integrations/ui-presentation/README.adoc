As this feature is under active development; behavior, schemas, and capabilities may change as the model evolves.
====

This section documents the *UI Presentation* model introduced as part of *StackPacks 2.0*.

== Overview

The Component Presentation model documented here declares how components (e.g., pods, VMs, services) are presented in the {stackstate-product-name} user interface.
It focuses exclusively on *presentation concerns*, such as naming, icons, tables, overview and highlight pages, filters, and menu item placement.

The goal of this model is to provide a more composable and extensible way to define UI behavior for components, compared to the existing, more fragmented approach.
