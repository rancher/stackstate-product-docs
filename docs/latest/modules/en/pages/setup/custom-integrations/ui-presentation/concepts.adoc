This is a summary of the most important concepts related to UI presentation and should be enough to get started.

== ComponentPresentation

The central concept of the UI Presentation model is the *ComponentPresentation*.

A `ComponentPresentation` defines how one or more matching components are presented in the UI, depending on the active context.
It focuses exclusively on *presentation concerns*, such as naming, icons, tables, overview and highlight pages, filters, and menu item placement.

At a high level, a ComponentPresentation:

* Selects components using a binding (a simple STQL query).
* Applies within a specific mode (for example, observability).
* Defines one or more presentation aspects (such as overview tables or highlights).
* Can partially define presentation properties and compose with other matching definitions.

Multiple ComponentPresentations may apply to the same component. In such cases, their definitions are combined to determine the final presentation.
