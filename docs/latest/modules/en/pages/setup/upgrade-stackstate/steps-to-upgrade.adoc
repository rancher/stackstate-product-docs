== Steps to upgrade

=== Minor or maintenance SUSE Observability release

A minor release of SUSE Observability is indicated by a change in the second digit of the version number, for example 4.1.0. Maintenance releases are identified by a change in the third digit of the version number, for example 4.1.1.

If you are upgrading to a new *minor* SUSE Observability release or a *maintenance* release, SUSE Observability itself and the StackPacks will be compatible with the current installation.

A minor upgrade consists of the following steps:

. <<_create_a_backup,Create a backup>>
. <<_upgrade_suse_observability,Upgrade SUSE Observability>>
. <<_verify_the_new_installation,Verify the new installation>>
. Check if any installed StackPacks require an upgrade

=== Major SUSE Observability release

A major release of SUSE Observability is indicated by a change in the first digit of the version number, for example 4.0.0.

If you upgrade to a new *major* SUSE Observability release, SUSE Observability and the installed StackPacks may be incompatible with the current installation. For details, check the xref:/setup/upgrade-stackstate/version-specific-upgrade-instructions.adoc[version-specific upgrade notes].

A major upgrade consists of the following steps:

. xref:/setup/upgrade-stackstate/steps-to-upgrade.adoc#_create_a_backup[Create a backup]
. Optional: xref:/setup/upgrade-stackstate/steps-to-upgrade.adoc#_uninstall_stackpacks_optional[Uninstall StackPacks]
