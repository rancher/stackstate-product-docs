:description: SUSE Observability Self-hosted

[CAUTION]
====
SaaS users of SUSE Observability can use Slack notifications without extra configuration. This guide is only applicable for self-hosted SUSE Observability installations, that are planning to use the Slack notification channel.
====


Before you can use the Slack notification channel in SUSE Observability, you first need to follow the following steps to set up both Slack and SUSE Observability:

. Create a Slack app for SUSE Observability in your workspace
. Configure SUSE Observability with the credentials for that Slack app.

== Creating a Slack app for SUSE Observability

[NOTE]
====
You need to have the permissions in Slack to manage Slack apps for your workspace.
====


Go to the https://api.slack.com/apps[Slack API page] and click on the *Create New App* button.

* Select the "From an app manifest" option in the dialog that opens.
* Select the workspace you want to send notifications to and click next.
* Copy the contents of the Slack app manifest below and paste it into the text area. Make sure to replace the values in `redirect_urls` with the URL(s) of your SUSE Observability instance. Click next.
* Verify that the URL is correct and that the "bot scopes" listed are `channels:join, channels:read, chat:write, groups:read` and click the create button to create the app.
* On the "Basic information" page of the App it's possible to change the icon (in the Display information section), you can replace it with, for example, the SUSE Observability logo image:logo/stackstate-logo.png[SUSE Observability logo,25,25].

== Configure SUSE Observability with the credentials for that Slack app

SUSE Observability needs to be configured with the credentials for the Slack app that you created. You can do this by adding the following to the `values.yaml` file of your SUSE Observability installation:

[,yaml]
----
stackstate:
  components:
    all:
      extraEnv:
        open:
          CONFIG_FORCE_stackstate_notifications_channels_slack_authentication_clientId: "<app client id>"
        secret:
          CONFIG_FORCE_stackstate_notifications_channels_slack_authentication_clientSecret: "<app client secret>"
----

The `<app client id>` and `<app client secret>` values can be found in the "App credentials" section on the "Basic Information" page of the Slack app you created. Apply these configuration changes by running the same Helm command used during installation of SUSE Observability (xref:/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_openshift/kubernetes_install.adoc#_deploy_suse_observability_with_helm[for Kubernetes] or xref:/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_openshift/openshift_install.adoc#_deploy_suse_observability_with_helm[OpenShift]).

You're now ready to use the Slack notification channel!
