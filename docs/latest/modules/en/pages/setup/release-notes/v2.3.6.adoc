== Bug Fixes

* *4000-HA Profile Limit Display:* Fixed an issue where the 4000-HA profile incorrectly reported the UI limit as 250.
* *StackGraph Console NullPointerException:* Resolved a `NullPointerException` that occurred when retrieving storage statistics in the StackGraph console.
* *Tephra Pod Stuck State in HA Setup:* Fixed a bug where the Tephra pod could become stuck in a non-functioning state during a specific restart order of Hadoop pods in an HA setup, particularly during upgrades.

=== Agent Bug Fixes
