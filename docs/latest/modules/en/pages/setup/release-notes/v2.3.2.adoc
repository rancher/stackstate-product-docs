== Release Notes: SUSE Observability Helm Chart v2.3.2

=== New Features & Enhancements

* *Analytics Deprecation:* The Analytics feature is now deprecated and disabled by default for all users. To re-enable it, grant the `access-analytics` and `execute-scripts` permissions to the relevant users or roles.
* *Log Noise Reduction:* Implemented a fix to suppress `x-forwarded-for` errors in logs when an IP:Port combination is used in the forwarding configuration.
* *Derived State Monitor:* Introduced a new "Derived State Monitor" feature, allowing the derivation of a state based on the status of logical components.

=== Bug Fixes

* *Traces in HA Profile:* Resolved an issue where the Traces functionality was partially disabled in the `4000-ha` profile.
* *Broken Link Fixes:* Fixed various broken links identified throughout the product user interface and documentation.
* *STS CLI Error Handling:* The STS CLI command for uploading a new stackpack now provides more informative and actionable error messages.
* *Private Agent Repository in Rancher:* Addressed various issues related to configuring and utilizing a private repository for the agent within the Rancher UI.
* *Logs API Key via Header:* The API key for accessing logs is now securely passed as a header in API requests.

== Agent Bug Fixes

* *Static Pod Log Scraping:* The agent has been enhanced to now scrape logs for static pods. This is achieved by utilizing the `kubernetes.io/config.mirror` annotation for system pods.
* *Secret Environment Variables:* Fixed an issue to ensure proper support for the `global.extraEnv.secret` configuration, allowing the addition of secret environment variables to the agent pods.
* *Process Agent Kernel Compatibility:* Enabled the process-agent to run on a wider range of Linux kernel versions, specifically between 5.0 and 5.11 (inclusive).
* *Private Image Registry* Fixed various issues around providing a private docker repository in the rancher UI.
