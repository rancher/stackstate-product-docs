== Release Notes: {stackstate-product-name} Helm Chart v2.6.2

== New Features & Enhancements

* *Automatic Common StackPack Management:* The **Common StackPack** is now automatically installed and upgraded. This simplifies custom StackPack creation, as the settings provided by the Common StackPack are available by default without requiring an explicit dependency configuration.
* *Monitor Timeline History:* The monitor timeline now displays all historic health statuses within the time range.
** Health statuses created *before* the upgrade will appear as individual entries.
** All statuses produced *after* the upgrade will be intelligently merged into a single status line for improved readability.
* *Monitors: Function Reference by ID:* Monitor functions can now be referenced by their unique identifier during import and export operations.
* *Open Telemetry Collector Upgrade:* The Open Telemetry collector has been upgraded.
* *OpenJDK and Dependency Upgrades:* OpenJDK and various library dependencies have been updated.
* *Helm Chart Warnings Removed:* Warnings that previously appeared when installing or upgrading the SUSE Observability Helm chart have been removed.

== Bug Fixes

* *Platform: Ephemeral Storage Limits:* Increased the ephemeral storage limits to **1Gi per pod** to prevent pod evictions on clusters that retain a large volume of logs.
* *Job and CronJob Configuration Consistency:* Ensured that `podAnnotations`, `podLabels`, `nodeSelectors`, `affinity`, and `tolerations` now correctly apply to all Jobs and CronJobs.
* *Job and CronJob Image Pull Secrets:* Ensured that all Jobs and CronJobs support the `global.imagePullSecrets` configuration.
* *Rancher Extension Session Fix:* The Rancher extension no longer reuses the existing browser session to fetch Observability state.
* *Platform: Kubernetes RBAC Agent Image Registry:* Fixed an issue where the `kubernetes-rbac-agent` was not picking up the `global.imageRegistry` Helm override value.
* *Platform: AMQP Exchange Support:* Fixed support for AMQP exchanges.
* *Open Telemetry Component Access:* Resolved an issue where Open Telemetry components were unavailable for users who had permissions to view the cluster data.
* *Missing Topology Permissions Spinner:* Fixed an issue where a user missing topology permissions would encounter a perpetual loading spinner.
