== Bug Fixes

* *OpenTelemetry Metric Scoping:* Fixed a critical issue where metrics ingested via the OpenTelemetry collector were missing the `_scope_` label. This prevented **scoped users** from being able to observe these metrics.
* *Metric Explorer Sorting:* The **Metric Explorer** now uses numerical sorting for values in the value column.
* *Platform: StackGraph Corruption (Timed-Out Transactions):* Fixed a **StackGraph corruption issue** where data from timed-out transactions that should have been rolled back could inadvertently reappear.
* *Platform: State Pod Validation:* Added **additional data validation and logging** to the state pod for improved stability and debugging.
* *StackGraph: Edge Deletion Invariant:* Added an invariant to prevent inconsistent edge references when performing a delete edge operation in **StackGraph**.
* *StackGraph Integrity Verifier:* An **experimental perpetual integrity verifier** has been added for StackGraph. It can be enabled by setting `hbase.console.integrity.enabled=true`.
* *StackPack Remediation Guides:* Fixed several remediation guides within the SUSE Observability stackpack that incorrectly referenced `tags` instead of the correct term, **`labels`**.
* *Duplicate OpenTelemetry StackPack:* Removed a duplicate **OpenTelemetry stackpack** installation.
* *Platform: Agent Restart Snapshot Loop:* Fixed an issue where a restart of an agent could cause the **'active snapshot'** to continuously occur.
* *Platform: Kafka JMX OOM Fix:* Resolved an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issue for the Kafka JMX container on RKE2 Kubernetes versions 1.31 and 1.30.

=== Agent Bug Fixes

* *Agent: /proc/<pid>/stat Panic:* The agent now includes a fix to prevent a panic when a `/proc/<pid>/stat` file is found to be empty.
