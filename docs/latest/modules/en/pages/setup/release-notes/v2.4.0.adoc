== Release Notes: SUSE Observability Helm Chart v2.4.0

NOTE: This release includes preparatory changes for the upcoming RBAC release.

WARNING: As a result of the upgrade to Java 21, the usage of the `StringTemplate` API in Monitor Functions and other Groovy scripts is deprecated. If you are using custom scripts please check for its usage and replace it with `StsStringTemplate`. The latter has the same API, only a different name. In a future release the backward compatibility support for `StringTemplate` will be removed.

== New Features & Enhancements

* *Agent: Dynatrace API Migration:* The Dynatrace Topology and Health checks have been migrated from the v1 to the v2 Dynatrace API.
* *Enhanced Security for Helm Chart:* Starting with version `v2.4.0`, all containers in the SUSE Observability Helm chart (with the exception of the Elasticsearch privileged init container) now have stricter `securityContext` defaults. This improves out-of-the-box security and ensures compatibility with clusters using highly restrictive Pod Security Admission (PSA) policies, such as the Rancher-restricted configuration.
** *Deployment on Restrictive PSA Clusters:* When deploying on clusters with a restrictive PSA policy, two installation options are now supported:
** *Namespace Exemption:* Exempt the chart's namespace along with other required Rancher namespaces.
** *Disable Privileged Init Container:* Set `elasticsearch.sysctlInitContainer.enabled=false`. Note that this requires manual adjustment of the `vm.max_map_count` setting on all relevant nodes.
**  The new defaults are:
....
`capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`
`seccompProfile.type: "RuntimeDefault"`
`runAsNonRoot: true`
`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
....
* *Java Runtime Upgrade to Java 21:* The runtime for StackGraph, StackState, and the Platform has been upgraded from Java 11 to Java 21. This upgrade introduces stricter encapsulation rules that may impact custom Groovy functions you have created.
** *Accessing private fields:* In previous versions it was possible to access private fields of objects in Groovy scripts. This was already a bad practice, but Java 21 makes that impossible. Replace the private field access with the appropriate getter/setter calls if you encounter this problem.
** *StackPack `StringTemplate` References:* In Groovy scripts for StackPack functionality, references to `StringTemplate` must be updated to `StsStringTemplate`, as `StringTemplate` is now an interface in Java 21.

* *Notification Filtering:* Notifications can now be filtered on resource tags. For each key, at least one value must match for the filter to apply.
* *Helm Configuration Key Renaming:* The `stackstate.experimental` Helm configuration key has been renamed to `stackstate.features`. The old key is still supported for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future release. **Upgrade Note:** If you have custom values, manually rename the key. If you are using a generated `sizing_values.yaml` file, you must regenerate it using the `--set 'basicConfig.generate=false'` option to update the key.
* *Performance Improvements:*
** *Views:* Performance for retrieving large views has been improved.
** *Authorization:* Authorization performance has been enhanced for users who belong to many (more than 10) groups.

== Bug Fixes

* *Removed Settings Page Functionality:* The "DataSource connection testing" and "Reset Sync" buttons have been removed from the settings page. The synchronization process now automatically resets after a configuration update.
* *Hadoop DataNode Performance:* Fixed an issue where DataNodes took a long time to locate a data block's new location, which could cause poor performance and backup failures.
* *Topology Health Aggregation:* The number of components reported in topology health aggregation monitors is now limited to prevent performance issues.
* *Permissions Migration:* Resolved an issue where permissions were not correctly migrated.

=== Agent Bug Fixes

* *Process Agent Panic:* The process agent now avoids a panic when PostgreSQL traffic is misclassified.
* *OpenMetrics Check:* Fixed an issue where the `openmetrics` check was unable to scrape data from pods.
* *Splunk Integration:* Added support for varying JWT authentication mechanisms for the Splunk integration.
* *Kubernetes Pod Enrichment:* Fixed an issue with pod enrichment on Kubernetes versions 1.33 and newer.
