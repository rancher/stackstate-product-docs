== Release Notes StackState version 7.0.0-snapshot.20240911112250-master-f9361e0 Helm Chart version 2.0.0

=== New Features & Enhancements:

This is the first release of SUSE Observability.
It has the same functionality as StackState helm chart version 1.11.4 but improved branding and an updated HBase 2.5.

It is not (yet) possible to upgrade from StackState 1.11.4 to SUSE Observability.

=== Changes:

* The "Show logs" button on the pods highlight page is removed. The logs are still accessible via the "View all" link on the logs widget that is on the same highlights page.
