== Release Notes: SUSE Observability Helm Chart v2.3.4

=== New Features & Enhancements

* *Elasticsearch Liveness Probe Timeout:* The `livenessProbe` timeout for Elasticsearch has been increased.
* *ClickHouse Installation on OpenShift:* Documentation has been added to guide users on how to install ClickHouse (one of the supported databases) on OpenShift.
* *Improved Trace Filtering:* The trace filtering functionality in the Traces UI has been enhanced. Attribute filters now select traces where at least one span within the trace matches all of the specified attributes.
* *Inclusion of Traces Without Root Spans:* Traces that lack a root span are now included in trace query results. This addresses scenarios where the root span might be missing due to timeouts, network connectivity issues, or misconfigurations of an OTel exporter.
* *Breaking Change: OpsGenie Notification Channel API:* The OpsGenie Notification Channel API now enforces strict enum matching for requests and responses, ensuring greater consistency in API interactions.
* *PostgreSQL Protocol Metrics:* New metrics have been added for PostgreSQL protocol latency and throughput.

=== Bug Fixes

* *Derived State Monitor Editing:* Fixed an issue that prevented correct editing of `componentTypes` for the derived state monitor function.
* *Topology Overflow Display:* The overview page now correctly displays a topology overflow message instead of an unexpected error page in the event of an overflow.

== Agent Bug Fixes

* *Agent Startup on Older Kernels:* Resolved an issue where the agent failed to start on kernels older than 5.8 due to a "bpf_probe_read not found" error.
