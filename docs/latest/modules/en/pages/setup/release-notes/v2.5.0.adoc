== Release Notes: SUSE Observability Helm Chart v2.5.0

== New Features & Enhancements

* *RBAC Integration:* We now translates Kubernetes roles and role bindings into SUSE Observability subjects with corresponding permissions and scopes. Access control is simplified, and roles can be provisioned using Rancher's "Role Templates."

* *Automated StackPack Updates:* All internal StackPacks will now be automatically updated during a SUSE Observability upgrade, ensuring you always have the latest versions.

== Bug Fixes

* *Cross-Origin Requests in Rancher UI:* Fixed an issue that prevented cross-origin requests, allowing observability data to be successfully fetched and displayed in the Rancher UI.
* *Overview Table Unit Display:* Corrected a bug where the overview table would default to "short" units. It now correctly displays the defined units (e.g., percent, kBites).
