The goal of this strategy is to ensure users always have access to the latest features, security updates, and
compatibility across all components.

== Release Cadence

Each component follows a rolling release model, with no fixed cadence:

* SUSE Observability Agents: Released as frequently as necessary, especially for security patches and performance optimizations.
* SUSE Observability Rancher UI Extension: Updated alongside major platform releases (Rancher and SUSE Observability) to maintain compatibility and user experience.

== Compatibility Guidelines

* The latest SUSE Observability Agent is always recommended, as it includes critical security fixes and performance improvements.
* The latest Agent is compatible with all supported versions of the SUSE Observability Platform.

corresponding to their Platform version.
