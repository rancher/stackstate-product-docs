== Release Notes: SUSE Observability Helm Chart v2.3.5

=== New Features & Enhancements

* *Default UI Time Range (Configurable):* The default time range displayed in the UI has been updated to 1 hour. This new default is designed to better align with common troubleshooting and monitoring workflows. Users can now configure this default time range via the `stackstate.ui.defaultTimeRange` Helm value. For more details, refer to the link:https://github.com/StackVista/helm-charts/tree/master/stable/suse-observability[SUSE Observability Helm Charts documentation].
* *Kubernetes Affinity Configuration:* The `suse-observability-values` generation now includes an additional file, `affinity_values.yaml`, which manages Kubernetes affinity settings. For High Availability (HA) profiles, `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` is now used by default. This ensures that replicas of database services are scheduled across different nodes, enhancing resilience. The documentation and installation commands have been updated to reflect these changes. For further information, refer to the xref:/setup/install-stackstate/kubernetes_openshift/affinity.adoc#_step_3_use_generated_values_in_helm_installation[SUSE Observability documentation on Kubernetes Affinity].

== Bug Fixes

* *StackPack Upgrade Race Condition:* Resolved a race condition that could occur when upgrading StackPacks with multiple instances or configurations. This fix prevents StackPack instances from becoming perpetually stuck in an upgrading state.
* *Duplicate Log Reporting:* Fixed an issue that caused logs to be reported in duplicate.

=== Agent Bug Fixes

* *WebSocket HTTP Traffic Latency:* Addressed an issue where WebSocket HTTP traffic metrics were being reported with abnormally high latency values.
