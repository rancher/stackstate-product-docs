:description: SUSE Observability

The xref:/setup/agent/k8sTs-agent-request-tracing.adoc#_enabling_the_trace_header_injection_sidecar[sidecar injection mechanism], which gets enabled when using `--set httpHeaderInjectorWebhook.enabled=true` when installing the agent, creates a self-signed certificate and uses a `ClusterRole` which grants write access to `Secret` and `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` objects in the Kubernetes cluster.

If for security purposes it is undesirable to create `ClusterRoles` which grant cluster-wide write rights, or there are alternative ways to provide a certificate:

. Generate a self-signed certificate <<_generate_a_certificate_locally,locally>>.
. Use the k8s https://cert-manager.io/[cert-manager] (if it already on the cluster) <<_generate_a_certificate_using_the_cert_manager,with a `ClusterIssuer`>>.

== Generate a certificate locally

To generate a certificate locally, take the following steps:

. Download the certificate generation script and run it to produce a helm values (`tls_values.yaml`) file with the right certificate:
+
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StackVista/http-header-injector/main/scripts/generate_ca_cert.sh
chmod +x generate_ca_cert.sh
./generate_ca_cert.sh <helm-agent-release-name> <helm-agent-namespace>
----
+
Be sure to use the release name that will be used in the helm command and the namespace, otherwise the certificate will be invalid.

. Install the agent adding the additional configuration by adding `--set httpHeaderInjectorWebhook.enabled=true -f tls_values.yaml` to the helm invocation command

== Generate a certificate using the cert-manager

If your cluster has the https://cert-manager.io/[cert-manager] installed, and a `ClusterIssuer` configured, it is possible to use the certificate issued by the `ClusterIssuer` in the agent for the sidecar injector. To do this, add the following command line arguments to install the agent: `--set httpHeaderInjectorWebhook.enabled=true --set-string httpHeaderInjectorWebhook.webhook.tls.mode="cert-manager" --set-string httpHeaderInjectorWebhook.webhook.tls.certManager.issuer="<my-cluster-issuer>"`. Be sure to replace my-cluster-issuer with the name of the issuer in your cluster.
