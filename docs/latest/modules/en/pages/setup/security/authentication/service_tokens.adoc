== Overview

Use the xref:use/security/k8s-service-tokens.adoc[Service Tokens] to authenticate authenticate to SUSE Observability without having an associated a user account. Service tokens are the preferred way to authenticate from CI/CD, or when sending telemetry data from agents or Open Telemetry. How to create and use service tokens is described in the xref:use/security/k8s-service-tokens.adoc[Service Tokens documentation].
