:description: SUSE Observability Self-hosted

== Overview

Permissions in SUSE Observability allow Administrators to manage the actions that each user or user group can perform inside SUSE Observability and the information that will be shown in their SUSE Observability UI. Only the feature set relevant to each user's active role will be presented. The actions, information and pages that a user doesn't have access to are simply not displayed in their SUSE Observability UI.

[NOTE]
====
Permissions are stored in StackGraph. This means that:

* If you perform an upgrade with "clear all data", permission setup will also be removed.
* To completely remove a user, they must also be manually removed from StackGraph.

== SUSE Observability permissions

There are two types of permission in SUSE Observability. *System permissions* scope user capabilities, such as access to settings, query execution and scripting. *Scoped permissions* determine access to observability data and some resource types like SUSE Observability Views.  For CRUD operations on SUSE Observability Views, these can be granted for a specific view or for all views. For details of the permissions attached to each predefined role in SUSE Observability, see xref:/setup/security/rbac/rbac_roles.adoc#_predefined_roles[predefined roles]

The following permissions are available in SUSE Observability:

|===
^[1]^ This is a *scoped permission*, the interpretation of the resource name depends on the context

=== Scoped permissions

You can grant certain permissions system-wide, or you can limit them to a subset of the resources.  You can give them a *Resource Name*, which indicates the scope.  The interpretation of this name is dependent on the type of resource.  Note that the scoping may apply to only some of the verbs.

* `views` - The name of the view
* `topology` - Any component label. In a Kubernetes environment, this can be, for example, `cluster-name:<cluster-name>` or `k8s-scope:<cluster-name>/<namespace>`
* `metrics` - In a Kubernetes environment, either `k8s:<cluster-name>:\\__any__` or `k8s:<cluster-name>:<namespace>`
* `traces` - In a Kubernetes environment, either `k8s.cluster.name:<cluster-name>` or `k8s.scope:<cluster-name>/<namespace>`
* `scoped-permissions` - The name of the cluster for which permissions are managed

== Manage permissions

You can manage SUSE Observability permissions using the `sts` CLI.
For scoped permissions, a resource name may be specified.  If none is given, the permission will be granted (or revoked) system-wide.

[NOTE]
====
*Important note:* All permissions in SUSE Observability are case sensitive.

=== List all available permissions

List all available permissions:

[,text]
----
sts rbac list-permissions
----

=== List all subjects

List all subjects:

[,text]
----
sts rbac describe-subjects

SUBJECT                                    | SOURCE
stackstate-admin                           | Static

suse-observability-agent-clusterA          | Observability
----
[NOTE]
====
`The subject `SOURCE` shows who owns and manages the subject. It can be one of our RBAC sources (Configuration|Static, Observability, Kubernetes)

* Configuration|Static: Subjects obtained via Suse Observability configuration through helm
* Observability: Subjects managed via the sts cli
* Kubernetes: Subjects obtained via RBAC agent from Kubernetes RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings
====

=== List subjects for a user

List all subjects that are assigned to the context, the first entry shown is the username, and potential roles the user has:

[,text]
----
sts user-session roles

user-dkzwh
keycloakoidc_group://suse-observability-instance-troubleshooter
keycloakoidc_group://suse-observability-instance-observer
keycloakoidc_group://suse-observability-cluster-observer
keycloakoidc_group://suse-observability-instance-admin
keycloakoidc_group://suse-observability-observer
----

List all subjects that are assigned to a user, by providing their `api-token`(useful as the admin can help debug users with less privileges):

[,text]
----
sts user-session roles --api-token [api-token]

u-3p775e7w7l
keycloakoidc_group://suse-observability-cluster-observer
----

=== Show granted permissions

Show the permissions granted to a specific user or role.

[,text]

[NOTE]
====
`--subject` can be any of the subjects available in the different RBAC sources (Configuration, Observability, Kubernetes)

== SUSE Observability UI with no permissions

Below is an example of how the SUSE Observability UI would look for a user without any permissions:
