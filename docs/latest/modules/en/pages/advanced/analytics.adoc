= Analytics page
:description: SUSE Observability Self-hosted

Analytics page provides a powerful and flexible interface to query and analyze your observability data using xref:/develop/reference/k8sTs-stql_reference.adoc[STQL queries].
This interactive environment empowers you to go beyond pre-built dashboards and gain deeper insights into the health, performance, and dependencies of your dynamic environment.

[CAUTION]
====
*The Analytics page is deprecated, but you can still enable it by configuring specific permissions. However, we strongly recommend leveraging StackPacks for enhanced observability and analysis, as they provide a more robust and actively supported alternative.*

Two permissions are required to enable Analytics Page:

* `access-analytics`
* `execute-scripts`

More details: xref:/setup/security/rbac/rbac_permissions.adoc[Permissions management]
