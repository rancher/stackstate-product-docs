:description: SUSE Cloud Observability user management

Users of the SUSE Cloud Observability tenants (SUSE Cloud Observability instances) are managed with https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak]. Each customer (tenant) has a dedicated Keycloak realm. A link to the Keycloak console is sent in the welcome message when a user is created.

SUSE Cloud Observability redirects users to Keycloak for authentication. Users are expected to be members of one or more Keycloak groups.

The predefined Keycloak groups:

* *realm-admin*: Members of this group can log in to the Keycloak realm console and perform user management operations.
* *stackstate-k8s-troubleshooter*: Users in this group are assigned the `stackstate-k8s-troubleshooter` Keycloak client role, which maps to the SUSE Cloud Observability role with the same name. The role grants regular SUSE Cloud Observability permissions.
* *stackstate-k8s-admin*: Users in this group are assigned the `stackstate-k8s-admin` Keycloak client role, which maps to the SUSE Cloud Observability role with the same name. The role grants privileged SUSE Cloud Observability permissions.

== User management URL

When a new user is created, they receive a welcome message containing a link to the Keycloak user management page. This link is *exclusively for the tenant administrator*, who is the first user by default. The URL format is: `https://<keycloak_FQDN>/realms/<your_dedicated_Keycloak_realm>/account`.
