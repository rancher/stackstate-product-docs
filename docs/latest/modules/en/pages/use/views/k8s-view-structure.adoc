== Overview

A view in SUSE Observability allows you to monitor and inspect a subset of your IT environment. The structure of a view is tailored towards filtering and visualizing the data in that subset (view) in an efficient way.

=== Filters

The *Filters* menu on the top right corner of the view UI allows you to filter the components (topology), events and traces displayed in a view. Once applied, the filters will affect the content of all the perspectives in a view.

* xref:/use/views/k8s-filters.adoc[Filters] - Filter the components (topology), events and traces in your view

=== Perspectives

The *Perspectives* of a view are displayed as tabs on the top left corner of the view UI and allow you to visualize all the data in a view through different lenses:

* xref:/use/views/k8s-overview-perspective.adoc[Overview perspective] or xref:/use/views/k8s-highlights-perspective.adoc[Highlights perspective] - depending on the type of view you are in
* xref:/use/views/k8s-topology-perspective.adoc[Topology perspective] - the dependency map of the view components
* xref:/use/views/k8s-events-perspective.adoc[Events perspective] - all the events happening on the topology
* xref:/use/views/k8s-metrics-perspective.adoc[Metrics perspective] - key metrics for the most relevant components
* xref:/use/views/k8s-traces-perspective.adoc[Traces perspective] - the tracing information running on the topology

[NOTE]
====
*All the perspectives* will update their content based on the xref:/use/stackstate-ui/k8sTs-timeline-time-travel.adoc[timeline] configuration.
